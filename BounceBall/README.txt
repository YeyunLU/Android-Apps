Bounce Ball - This app is for Bounce Ball games.
There are two balls in this app. You are supposed to shake your phone and move the bottom ball to bounce a moving ball.
Also, you can choose the speed levels you like in this game through a fragment in the main page.
Every time two balls collide, you will get some scores weighted by the speed (i.e. difficulty of the game).
Your scores will be recorded and the app will list the top 5 results in the form of bar graph view.
